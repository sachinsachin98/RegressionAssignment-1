    "Linear regression relies on several key assumptions to provide valid and reliable results. It's important to assess whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset to ensure that the regression analysis is appropriate. Here are the main assumptions of linear regression and methods to check them:\n",

    "Linearity: This assumption assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. You can check this assumption by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating scatterplots to visually inspect whether the data points roughly form a linear pattern.\n",
    "Plotting the residuals (the differences between actual and predicted values) against the predicted values to ensure that there is no clear pattern, which would indicate non-linearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Examine a plot of residuals over time or in the order of data collection. There should be no systematic patterns or correlations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating a plot of residuals against the predicted values. If the spread of residuals varies systematically with the predicted values, it indicates heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance).\n",
    "Performing statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or the White test to formally test for heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: Linear regression assumes that the residuals follow a normal distribution. You can check this assumption by:\n",

    "Creating a histogram or a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of the residuals and comparing them to a normal distribution. If the residuals deviate significantly from normality, it may indicate a problem.\n",
    "Using statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test to formally test for normality.\n",
    "No or Little Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated. This can make it challenging to distinguish the individual effects of predictors. You can check for multicollinearity by:\n",

    "Calculating correlation coefficients between pairs of independent variables. High correlation values (e.g., above 0.7 or 0.8) suggest potential multicollinearity.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept have specific interpretations that help us understand the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. Here's how you interpret the slope and intercept:\n",

    "Intercept (a):\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable (Y) when all independent variables (X) are set to zero. It's the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis.\n",

    "The sign of the slope (+ or -) indicates the direction of the relationship. If the slope is positive, an increase in the independent variable is associated with an increase in the dependent variable. If it's negative, an increase in the independent variable is associated with a decrease in the dependent variable.\n",

    "Suppose you want to predict a person's salary (Y) based on their years of experience (X). You perform a simple linear regression analysis and obtain the following model:\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercept (a = 30,000): The intercept represents the estimated salary when a person has zero years of experience. In this context, it may not be practically meaningful because no one has zero years of experience, and you can't have a salary without some level of experience. Therefore, the intercept doesn't have a direct interpretation in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope (b = 1,500): The slope represents the estimated change in salary for each additional year of experience. In this case, the slope of 1,500 means that, on average, for each additional year of experience, a person's salary is expected to increase by $1,500.\n",

    "Gradient descent starts at an initial point and repeatedly updates the parameters by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient, taking small steps (learning rate) in each iteration. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a predefined number of iterations or a sufficiently small gradient magnitude.\n",
    "Usage in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is widely used in machine learning for training models, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and many other algorithms.\n",

    "The parameters of the model (e.g., weights in a neural network) are adjusted iteratively using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.\n",

    "a. Initialize the model parameters randomly or with some initial values.\n",
    "b. Compute the cost function based on the current parameters and the training data.\n",
    "c. Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "d. Update the parameters by subtracting the gradient multiplied by a learning rate.\n",
    "e. Repeat steps b to d for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.\n",
